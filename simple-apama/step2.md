To run an Apama application from the command line, the `Correlator` needs to know which files and configuration to use. 
This is provided by an `initialization.yaml` file, often generated by running the `engine_deploy` command (Not part of the core version, or this tutorial).

## Run the application

`correlator --config initialization.yaml`{{execute}}
