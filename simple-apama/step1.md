The Apama environment consists of the correlator (the Apama language runtime) and various command line tools for interacting with the correlator.

##Â Source the Environment

To make the environment available for use on the command line we need to source the `apama_env`:

`. /opt/softwareag/Apama/bin/apama_env`{{execute}}

The Windows `cmd` equivalent to this is:

`C:\SoftwareAG\Apama\bin\apama_env`
