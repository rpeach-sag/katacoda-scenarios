The Apama environment consists of:
- **The Correlator** - the Apama language runtime 
- **Command line tools** - for interacting with the correlator.

##Â Sourcing the Environment

To make all of the tools available for use on the command line we need to source the `apama_env`:

```
. /opt/softwareag/Apama/bin/apama_env
```{{execute}}

The Windows `cmd` equivalent to this is:

```
C:\SoftwareAG\Apama\bin\apama_env
```
